I analyzed CMS data related to claims reimbursement made to each state in 3 different claim types; 
1. Vaccination 
2. Test
3. Treatment 

My goal was to identify correlation between vaccination rate and treatment rate by factoring in states population. Based on the data I found out that certain states could have reduced treatment claims drastically if they increased vaccination rate. Cost of treatment were much higher than vaccination claims, increasing vaccination reate could have saved the goverment a lot of money and resources. 

My other goal was to analyze data to find out whether America's Rescure plan reach to the poeople and communties who needed it  the most, in other words communities with high poverty level. What I discovered  was that the plan really could not achieved its goals becuase the most of the claims were paid in the communites which are not in the poor areas per the goverment census data.
