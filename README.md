Which States had the highest treatmetn claims?

What was the vaccination to treatment ration? 

I analyzed CMS data related to claims reimbursement made to each stete in 3 different claim type; 
1. Vaccination 
2. Test
3. Treatment 

My goal was to identify correlation between vaccination rate and treatment rate by factoring in states population. Based on data I found out that certain states could have reduced treatment claims drastically if they increated vaccination rate. 

My other objective was to analyze data to find out whether America's Rescure plan reach to the poeople and communties who needed the most, in other words communities with high poverty level. What I discovered  was that the plan really could not achieved its goals becuase most of the claims were paid in the communites which are not considered poor areas.
